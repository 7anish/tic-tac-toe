# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols, usually "X" and "O", aiming to get three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

It's a simple yet strategic game that tests players' ability to anticipate and block their opponent's moves while planning their own winning strategies.
